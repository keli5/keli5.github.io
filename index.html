      <h2>Who?</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm keli5, letters in some circles, or maybe keli5_letters. You can pretty much call me whatever.<br>
        I spend a lot of time <a href="/projects.html">programming</a> or <a href="/projects.html">mapping</a> for whatever game or library 
        has my interest at the moment, whether it be Unity, Garry's Mod or just my bot.
      </p>
      <h2>Where?</h2>
      <p>
        You can find me in one of a few places:
        <ul>
          <li>on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/keli5">keli5_letters</a></li>
          <li>on Discord: <b>keli5_letters#7699</b>. This is your best bet at getting a hold of me.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>What?</h2>
      <p>
        I'm familiar with a good lot of languages, engines, etc. I figure it's worth putting them here.
        <ul>
          <li>Unity (C#)</li>
          <li>Source (Hammer, GLua)</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>JavaScript (frontend + backend)</li>
          <li>HTML/CSS (obviously)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>When?</h2>
      <p>I've been programming as a hobby for, as of 2023, 5 years! My time zone is US/Canada central (or America/Chicago for some of you,) and I'm normally awake from around 7 AM to 8 or 9 PM. The all nighters really aren't my thing.</p>
      <h2>Why?</h2>

      </figure>
      <p>In reality, I just do it because I like it. It gives me something to keep my mind moving and take up my free time if I don't want to play games, map, etc.</p>
      <h2>How?</h2>
      <p>My main environment right now is a Windows 10 machine with an i5-9500 and a GT 1030. I dual boot with <a href="https://endeavouros.com/">Endeavour OS.</a></p>
