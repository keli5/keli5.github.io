            <h1 class="postHeader">The Year of Linux on the Desktop</h1>
            <h2 class="postTagline">Every year is the year of Linux on the desktop. But some year, right?</h2>
            <h3>Prologue</h3>
            <p>
                Now, let me start off this post by saying, I'm a big fan of Linux! I just don't use it, since I play a lot of games,
                and a fair portion of these games lie somewhere on a spectrum from "doesn't support Linux because the devs didn't build
                it for Linux" to "the devs outright refuse to support Linux." However, unlike some Linux users, I enjoy playing games with
                my friends, so simply not playing these games isn't really an option. Development on Windows with WSL works fine for me, but
                I'm still a big fan of a lot of the philosophies and etc. behind Linux. Now, onto the content, shall we? 
            </p>
            <h3>Inconsistency</h3>
            <p>
                The first thing that strikes me about "Linux on the desktop" is that there are so <i>many</i> desktops. Linux has a very
                diverse ecosystem. And don't get me wrong, that can be a good thing! But with Linux, there's so much diversity that with all
                of the possible combinations of tools, desktops, window managers, underlying distros and everything else you can change up,
                weird edge cases and bugs in combinations are <i>guaranteed.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                These are bugs that don't happen on any other OS, because of the single choice for things like the desktop and WM being
                locked in. And if you're knowledgable about Computer, and have the time, determination and knowledge to fix these issues,
                by all means, go right ahead! But for the average Joe who just wants to turn on his computer and play some video games
                with his buddies or read the news, this is a major turnoff.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't think these inconsistencies are ever going to be "fixed," because this fragmentation seems to be what a lot of people
                actually like Linux for. The absurd amount of choice and freedom you get is very nice - if you know what you're doing.
            </p>

            <h3>"But it has a GUI!"</h3>
            <p>
                Plenty of people, companies, etc. have built GUI frontends for package managers such as apt and pacman to ease things like
                installing packages so you <i>don't have to use the terminal!</i> But, as I just outlined, the Linux ecosystem is diverse,
                to a point that causes issues. These GUIs might work great in their intended environment!
            </p>
            <p>
                But as soon as you want to use a different desktop, or a different distro, that GUI breaks horribly, or just doesn't exist anymore.
                Anyone who used Ubuntu back in 2016 especially can testify to this, though that's an unfair comparison - 2016 is 7 years ago,
                after all. But this issue is still around today, albeit much better than it used to be.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an example, I've lost count of how many times I've downloaded a Cinnamon taskbar widget on a system that's not Mint and watched it
                not work because it expects PulseAudio and I'm using PipeWire, or it uses some library that doesn't exist in that system's repos, or
                some other configuration issue that would require anything from a few hours of debugging to entirely reconfiguring my system.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Software compatibility</h3>
            <p>
                Oh, boy.<br>
                Plenty of software works on Linux, yeah! We've got software that offers native Linux versions. We've got WINE and Proton to run 
                Windows apps that don't offer Linux versions. We've got alternatives (see: Microsoft Office vs. LibreOffice / Google Docs) to
                your Windows apps that can even read the files your Windows apps output.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now try to play a non-Steam game with Wine or Proton.<br>
                I don't know about you, but I've never had good experiences playing non-Steam Windows games on Linux. Maybe that's a very specific
                problem, but I can't see it being that uncommon since the average Windows user has 1 launcher per 3 games at this point. I've lost
                count of how much time I've lost to setting up WINE prefixes with different combinations of d3dcompiler DLLs and DXVK versions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even Proton doesn't do the job perfectly. Sure, for a lot of games, it works fine! What if you want to play a game that's not one
                of those games? Let's take Garry's Mod as an example. Every update or two, you have to go and fuck around with the native Linux
                version, or Proton 5 and 4, or whatever launch options you need this week to get the game to run. Also, if native is the preferred
                version today, there's no main menu. At all. And this has been a known issue with the native version for <i>years.</i> They just
                can't be bothered to fix it. Lovely.
            </p>

            <h3>The Catch-22</h3>
            <p>
                But you know why they don't bother to fix Linux support? It's because Linux users are the minority, by far. If we look at desktop
                market share overall, <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide">Linux isn't doing so hot.</a> Even if
                we assume all those Unknown users are actually Linux users and not something else, that's still just over 15%. So now a problem makes
                itself apparent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Developers don't bother making games, building software, etc. for Linux because Linux users are the minority.<br>
                Windows users don't want to switch to Linux because software compatibility is so poor since developers aren't bothering with Linux.<br>
                Developers don't see any reason to build for Linux since it just takes extra time and effort, and all our users are on Windows anyways,
                and the program probably works fine in WINE anyways (it doesn't), so why bother?<br>
                This spiral can go on for an eternity, but it's 6 AM and I'm tired.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>If someone asked me, I'd say I like Linux overall. The customization and technicality of it is something I like. But that technicality
                is still present in modern Linux, and that technicality isn't for everyone. I can't in good conscience recommend any Linux distro to
                someone looking for a daily driver except <i>maybe</i> something like Mint or Ubuntu. And I really just can't see the Linux desktop
                making it mainstream, not until at least some of these problems are fixed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I guess that's it. Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening, wherever you may live.
